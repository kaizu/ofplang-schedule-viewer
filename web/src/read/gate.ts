/**
 * Feature gate — can this viewer render the document faithfully?
 *
 * This is not validation. `ofplang-validate` decides whether a document is
 * valid v0; this decides whether *this viewer* understands it. The workflow
 * spec draws exactly that line: "If a document requires a feature that is
 * defined by v0 but not supported by a particular implementation, the document
 * is valid v0 but unsupported by that implementation" (§4.4).
 *
 * The viewer supports **none** of the seven optional v0 features. Saying so
 * plainly is the point — a silently wrong picture is worse than a refusal.
 *
 * The decision rests on what the document *requires*, derived from its body,
 * not on what it declares. `features` may over-declare (§4.1: extra features
 * "are allowed and do not change the semantics"), so a document that lists
 * `node_map` but never uses one still renders. The declared set is reported
 * alongside, because the mismatch is worth showing a human.
