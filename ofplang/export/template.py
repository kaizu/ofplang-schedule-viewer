"""The single-file viewer template, and putting documents into it.

The contract is one element (design.md D48), written by `web/scripts/embed.mjs`
for the tests and by this module for everyone else:

    <script type="application/json" id="ofp-documents" data-contract="1">…</script>

Its content is `null` or `{ name, plan?, workflow?, environment?, ui? }`, each
document being the YAML text as written. `<` is written as `\\u003c` — a JSON
escape, so a `</script>` in a YAML comment cannot end the element and the text
arrives unchanged.
